<p>This mod provides a Training system to your kerbalnauts by adding a training center into all science laboratories. Training consumes Time and Electric Charge.</p>
<p><del>(KPBS Supported)</del> Patch now adds a Field Training Facility to all parts with a science lab.</p>
<p>This mod is similar with Field Training Laboratory (and cooperates with FTL), But one thing is different. It consumes Time and Electric Charge.</p>
<p>If you want level 5 kerbalnaut from level 0, You need to train your kerbal for 1 year. Becoming level 1 will only need to wait 13 days, But as you know, high level needs more training.</p>
<p>But, If you place your facility into orbit, It will be 4 times faster. If you place it on other planet, 6 times faster.</p>
<p>You can tweak params with .cfg. Not so complex.</p>
<p>It consumes 4 EC/sec per kerbal. If you train 2 kerbals, It will drain 8 EC/sec. You will need powerful energy sources.</p>
<p>If you want to train your kerbal immediately, you can use these mods. (Dependency : <embed src="http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-12-*" /></p>
<p>[1.7.x] Training Laboratory <img src="http://spacedock.info/mod/978" alt="Spacedock" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IA449bT.png" alt="FieldTrainingFacility" /></p>
<p>This mod provides Training method with consuming Science points. Paying 20 sci, your kerbal can get 1 exp. Since leveling up method is very limited, you have to pay science point once enough to advance level.</p>
<p>If your Training Lab is in orbit, Training costs will be reduced 50%. If your Lab is on other planet, Training costs will be reduced by 75%.</p>
<p>You can tweak values by editing .cfg. If you want, you can add this module to other crewed part. It can support up to 8 kerbalnauts.</p>
<p>Leveling up 'Immediately' is not realistic? Do you think Training needs time consuming? This mod will be answer for you. <img src="https://github.com/zer0Kerbal/FieldTrainingFacility" alt="FieldTrainingFacility" /></p>
<hr />
<p>Now then, someone like me will want to use both. Then, just install both of them. Result is shown below. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FoeIXB6.png" alt="Both Installed" /></p>
<p>Payment of science point(Field Training Facility(<code>FTL</code>)) will be reduced with training experiences(Field Training Facility (<code>FTF</code>).</p>
<p>For example - Just using FTL, Level 4 -&gt; Level 5 consumes 640p of Science points. But Level 4(50% with FTF) -&gt; Level 5 consumes just 320p of science point. If 90% with FTF? Just pay 64p of science point or wait some more days. you can get level 5 kerbalnaut.</p>
<p>More training means less sci point needed, linearly.</p>
