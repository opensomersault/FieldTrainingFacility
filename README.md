# FieldTrainingFacility
 This mod adds training center at laboratory. Paying science point, Gets kerbal experiences(stars).
 
This mod provides Training system to your kerbalnauts.
~(KPBS Supported)~ Patch now adds a Field Training Facility to all parts with a science lab.

This mod is similar with Training Laboratory, But one thing is different. It consumes Time and Electric Charge.

If you want level 5 kerbalnaut from level 0, You need to train your kerbal for 1 year. Becoming level 1 will only need to wait 13 days, But as you know, high level needs more training.

But, If you place your facility into orbit, It will be 4 times faster.
If you place it on other planet, 6 times faster.

You can tweak params with .cfg. Not so complex.

It consumes 4 EC/sec per kerbal. If you train 2 kerbals, It will drain 8 EC/sec. You will need powerful energy sources. 

If you want to train your kerbal immediately, you can use these mods.

This mod provides Training method with consuming Science points.
Paying 20 sci, your kerbal can get 1 exp. Since leveling up method is very limited, you have to pay science point once enough to advance level.

If your Training Lab is in orbit, Training costs will be reduced 50%.
If your Lab is on other planet, Training costs will be reduced by 75%.

You can tweak values by editing .cfg. If you want, you can add this module to other crewed part. It can support up to 8 kerbalnauts.

 

Leveling up 'Immediately' is not realistic? Do you think Training needs time consuming? This mod will be answer for you. ![FieldTrainingFacility](https://github.com/zer0Kerbal/FieldTrainingFacility)
