Hello everyone, I'd like to present a work-in-progress plugin that adds a little to the Map View.

Please let me know if you find it useful or if you have any features to suggest.

Available on KerbalStuff: https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/1122/MapViewPlus

Source available on Github: https://github.com/rmpalomino/mapviewplus

    Javascript is disabled. View full album

Features:

    Adds a window allowing you to change focus to any maneuver nodes / celestial bodies / return to the current ship without having to cycle with Tab or Left-Shift + Tab.
    Does not lock default cycling (or return to ship with Backspace) so you can still Tab or Left + Shift-Tab if you prefer
    Opens the Navball by default when entering Map View

Installation

    Unzip the archive.
    Copy the MapViewPlus folder in MapViewPlus[X.X]/GameData/ to your [KSP Directory]/GameData/ folder.
    Test it out and give me some feedback.

    v0.1.1

        Fixed ApplicationLauncher icon
        Fixed non-interactive navball in Mapview
